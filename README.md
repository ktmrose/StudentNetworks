# Student Networks and Meyers Briggs Personalities
## TLDR
Models students and their last three partners worked with using D3 for interactive visualization. Students also self-reported Meyers-Briggs personality. Running MBPIVis.html dynamically and interactively allows the user to visually map out relationships between people and identify patterns in MBP trait patterns.

## Background
Meyers-Briggs Personality Indicator (MBPI) is personally a fascinating subject to me. When my Data Analysis and Visualization class final required creating interactive visualization of a dataset of our choice, I knew what to do. This final was the perfect opportunity to test out a personal hypothesis: did certain personality types tend to work with other certain personality types?

## Survey Methods
Collecting data consisted of sending a survey to my classmates with only three questions:
- What is your name
- What is your Meyers Briggs personality
- Who were the last three people you pair programmed with?

It was assumed that by this point, our classmates were well acquainted with each other to get a sense of what partners were most compatible with each other. The survey was open for five days. Approximately half the class responded.
